SUMMARY: The next few sections wrap up our discussion of data structures. We'll finish with a bang by covering hash tables --- certainly one of the most important data structures --- in detail. First we discuss hash table basics --- the supported operations, the types of problems they're useful for, and an overview of implementation approaches. Universal Hashing has one required video about "pathological data sets" for hash functions, and three optional videos that cover great stuff --- how randomization dodges pathological data sets, a construction of simple hash functions that are guaranteed to (in expectation over the choice of a random hash function) spread every data set out evenly, and performance analyses of hashing with both chaining and open addressing. Bloom Filters contains two required videos on the implementation and performance of bloom filters, which are like hash tables except that they are insanely space-efficient and occasionally suffer from false positives.
